# english_learning_tools

## Project Overview
english_learning_tools is a Python project designed to enhance English learning, focusing specifically on improving speaking skills. By integrating multiple modules, you can download audio files from YouTube, transcribe them, clean the data, and evaluate learners' performance.

## Features
1. **Download Audio and Transcript**
   - Input a YouTube URL to download the .wav audio file and its transcript.
2. **Speech Recognition**
   - Use OpenAI Whisper to recognize speech and convert audio to text.
